# Hi!

I'm Pedro, aka pta2002. I'm currently doing a masters in Computer Engineering
at UMinho.

For the past few years, I've gotten deep into the Nix/NixOS ecosystem, and as
such have started a few projects revolving around it, notably
[NixVim](https://github.com/pta2002/nixvim), which is actively getting
contributions from several other people.
